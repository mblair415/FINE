Martin also suggested using a pie chart to visually represent the data from the kitchens and the donators.  Using a pie chart to display 6 states of information for a kitchen wasn't something I had time for with the brief project duration.  My plan was to break the pie into 3rds for each food type (protein, starch, veggie), then break each of those 33.33% of a circle portions into sections according to how much of a thing was requested where all that was requested would be 100% of 33.33%, so if someone requested 30 lbs of protein and had received 15 lbs the protein portion of their pie chart would be 50% full or 15.165% of the full pie chart.  The pie chart I was going to try to work with:http://canvasjs.com/editor/?id=http://canvasjs.com/example/gallery/pie/new-year-resolution/
