## A dumpster fire of an angular app
It's ugly, it doesn't work well and it's a fraction of what I hoped to complete, but at least it took a lot of time.

Martin also suggested using a pie chart to visually represent the data from the kitchens and the donators.  To do this I need to use a pie chart to display 6 states of information for a kitchen wasn't something I had time for with the brief project duration.  My plan was to break the pie into 3rds for each food type (protein, starch, veggie), then break each of those 33.33% of a circle portions into sections according to how much of a thing was requested where all that was requested would be 100% of 33.33%, so if someone requested 30 lbs of protein and had received 15 lbs the protein portion of their pie chart would be 50% full or 15.165% of the full pie chart.  The pie chart I was going to try to work with:http://canvasjs.com/editor/?id=http://canvasjs.com/example/gallery/pie/new-year-resolution/


### Next steps
* Create a fully crudable back end with profile pages for each organization.  Any organization viewing their own will be able to edit it (that will require login)
- each restaurant should be able to save specific types as frequent donation items. For example a bakery may often have dinner rolls to donate and may very rarely have croissants.  The bakery would be able to place dinner rolls on a list of frequently donated items that will auto populate when they login.
- the data card that populates on the map will link to the profile page for that organization.  
* Login to replace the landing page
* Something to make it less hideous.  Maybe a voodoo sacrifice.
* The map page should organize hits in order of distance and it should be possible to also see which organizations need or have the most of what someone has to offer.
* With a whole lot more time I may be able to get images to appear on the informational cards on the map.  Early testing produced full sized images (which didn't fit within the limits of the card) and the nature of having to insert the HTML into the JavaScript makes this a cumbersome process that is very time consuming to iterate on.
* An about page with information on major organizations in the area that collect for those who are less fortunate and a variety of ways for people to give back to the community in the most effective ways possible including places that accept donations and can stretch each dollar with bulk purchases and organizations that are looking for volunteers.
* A faq with real information about the food insecure and a number of common myths presented and corrected.
